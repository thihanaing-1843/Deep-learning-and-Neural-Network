# Deep-learning-and-Neural-Network
Deep Learning is a machine learning subset using neural networks to find complex patterns in data, enabling tasks like image and speech recognition. Neural Networks consist of interconnected layers of nodes that process and learn from data, with deep networks (many layers) enhancing pattern recognition and predictive accuracy.
